# 🧩 MatricLink

> Bridging learners, educators, and opportunities through an accessible digital platform.

MatricLink is a cross-platform educational application built with **.NET MAUI** (Multi-platform App UI) and **Blazor Hybrid**, combining native performance with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The app connects seamlessly to the [MatricLinkWebsite](https://matriclink.vercel.app) repository hosted on Vercel, enabling consistent web and mobile experiences from a unified codebase.

---

## 📱 Overview

MatricLink provides learners with access to:

- Educational resources
- User profiles
- Sign-up and login functionality
- Integrated data management

All through an elegant, responsive interface that runs both **offline and online**, synchronizing data with the hosted web version whenever internet access is available.

## ⚙️ Core Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | UI/UX and interactive components |
| **App Framework** | .NET MAUI + Blazor Hybrid | Cross-platform native app structure |
| **Language** | C# | Backend logic, data handling, and API interop |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Front-end deployment and continuous delivery |
| **Source Control** | Git & Git Submodules | Unified versioning of app and front-end |
| **Database** | *(Planned)* SQLite / Azure SQL | User data and state persistence |

---

## 🧠 Architecture

MatricLink is structured around a **hybrid architecture** where the frontend repository (hosted on Vercel) is added as a Git submodule inside the MAUI project.

### Project Structure

```
MatricLink/
│
├── MatricLink/                     # MAUI app root
│   ├── wwwroot/                    # Local web assets (mirrors hosted site)
│   ├── Components/                 # Blazor/MAUI hybrid UI components
│   ├── Platforms/                  # Platform-specific code (Android, iOS, Windows)
│   ├── Resources/                  # Fonts, images, splash screens
│   ├── App.xaml / App.xaml.cs      # Core app configuration
│   ├── MainPage.xaml / .cs         # Main interface with WebView
│   └── MauiProgram.cs              # Dependency injection and service setup
│
└── MatricLinkWebsite/              # Git submodule (Vercel-hosted frontend)
    ├── index.html
    ├── css/
    ├── js/
    └── assets/
```

### Hybrid Loading Logic

```csharp
#if DEBUG
    webView.Source = "https://matriclink.vercel.app";  // Remote (online)
#else
    webView.Source = "wwwroot/app/index.html";          // Local (offline)
#endif
```

- **Debug Mode:** Loads the hosted site from Vercel for live testing
- **Release Mode:** Loads the local wwwroot copy for offline or deployed app use

---

## 🧩 JavaScript & Interop

Each HTML page uses its own dedicated JS file for modularity during development:

```
js/
 ├── signup.js
 ├── login.js
 ├── profile.js
 └── utils.js
```

These can later be **bundled into one optimized file** for production. C# and JavaScript communicate through **JS Interop**, allowing backend logic to handle authentication, data persistence, and API requests.

---

## 🔄 Data & Backend Integration

### Planned Backend Stack (C#)

- **SQLite or Azure SQL** for storing user data locally or in the cloud
- **Entity Framework Core** for ORM-based database access
- **HttpClient** for API calls between C# and hosted services (e.g., REST endpoints)

This enables **offline-first data handling** — syncing automatically when the user reconnects.

---

## 💻 Cross-Platform Compatibility

MatricLink runs seamlessly across:

- ✅ **Windows** (desktop)
- ✅ **Android** (mobile and tablet)
- 🔜 **iOS, MacCatalyst, and Tizen** (future expansion)

Responsive layout ensures consistent UI across varying screen sizes and resolutions.

## 🚀 Deployment

| Environment | Description | Access |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 🌐 **Web** | Hosted version of the app frontend | [matriclink.vercel.app](https://matriclink.vercel.app) |
| 📱 **Mobile/Desktop** | MAUI-built native app | Distributed via app stores or installer packages |

---

## 🧭 Development Workflow

### 1. Clone Main Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/MatricLink.git
```

### 2. Initialize Submodule (Frontend)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/SakhileKhuzwayo222/MatricLinkWebsite.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Run in Debug Mode

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### 4. Publish for Release

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```
